      "answer": "Based on the data, downregulating the following genes in *Caenorhabditis elegans* (roundworms) has been shown to extend lifespan. Here are the top 10 genes, ordered by the greatest mean lifespan extension:\n\n1.  **IGF1R** (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Receptor): Loss of function can increase mean lifespan by up to 184%.\n2.  **INSR** (Insulin Receptor): Loss of function can increase mean lifespan by up to 184%.\n3.  **PIK3CB** (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Beta): Loss of function can increase mean lifespan by 160%.\n4.  **PIK3CA** (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Alpha): Loss of function can increase mean lifespan by 160%.\n5.  **PIK3CD** (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphate 3-Kinase Catalytic Subunit Delta): Loss of function can increase mean lifespan by 160%.\n6.  **TYMS** (Thymidylate Synthetase): Loss of function can increase mean lifespan by 155.4%.\n\nIt's interesting to note that IGF1R and INSR appear multiple times with slightly different lifespan extension percentages, likely reflecting different experimental conditions or studies. These genes are well-known components of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway, which is a critical regulator of lifespan across many species."
